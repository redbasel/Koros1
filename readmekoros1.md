* READ ME FOR KOROS1 *

** KOROS1 overview **
Koros1 represents the prototype for companys KOROS paltform for coaches and their clients. The thought behidn the project is to create a platform where coches and clients are borght closer and can work more efficiently. The clients will wupdate te coaches on their progress frequently and in a quality manner. FRom the clients persepctive the goal is to make the platform their "one-stop-shop" for all their materials and support in order to help them reach their individual goals. 

*KOROS1 Relation to coming KOROS# projects**
KOROS1 is not intended to be a ocmpelte funciton of the KOROS platform. Thsi readme file will dispaly what i srelevant for KOROS1. Fututre readme's of KOROS# will say wha thaas been added and furthermore what is new language wise. Koros1 will only utilize HTML and CSS whereas future KOROS# will incorporate python, javascript etc. 

KOROS1 focus is on creating the dashboard, navigation and first function which is the evaluation form sent by client to the coach.

*USER STORIES*
**DESKTOP**
Desktop users will benefit from the sidenavigation so they can quickly toggle between the functions. The users will use desktop in majority and thus are prioritized. The boxnavigation greets them with a clear and intutive menu. 

**MOBILE**
Mobile users will not benefit from the sidenav and is thus hidden for the mobile users. The mobile users will have the boxnavigation dashboard which is suitable because they are using their fingers nd not precise mouse. So it is more comfortable for the user. 

*FEATURES*

The dashboard presents all the functions for the user in a userfriendly and effective way. It is achieved by utilizig a box style with clear headings and icons as well as distinctive colors. This design is mobile friendly as well. See the embedded picture of the wireframe used. Where the box concept along with sidenavigation is clearly displayed with the strong colors against the bright background.

****SIDENAVIGATION****
The sidenavigation allows users to quickly change functions while using one function already without having to go back to the startpage. Thisi is greatly beneficial for the desktop users. For the mobile users it might obscure the view and thus will have to be adapted.

The information page keeps track on the progress of the different sections of the platform .
